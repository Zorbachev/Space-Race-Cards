Warp & Peace (Preconstructed Deck) Primer


Summary:
   
   Warp & Peace intends to focus on a tempo gameplan where turns alternate
   between utility Actions like Read the Manual or Hire a Hitman and "Warp"
   effects that lock you out of Proximity gain for 1 Round. This has inherent
   synergy with Research Modules, which will trigger at the start of a Turn, 
   preventing their next trigger, allowing you to gain Proximity that Turn
   without consequence. 


Modes:

1. Hop, Skip and, Jump
   
   This mode focuses on leaning into the more straightforward gameplan of Turns
   which alternate between Certainty/Proximity gain and more generic utility,
   simply making consistent progress until the finish.

2. Keep the Peace

   Keep the Peace is a more interactive set-up, intending to leverage value
   from Kallipher and Oculon to disrupt opponent's gameplans while using Weapon
   granting from CPL.Punishment to discourage your opponent's from interfering
   in yours.
