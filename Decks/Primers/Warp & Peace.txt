Warp & Peace (Preconstructed Deck) Primer


Summary:
   
   Warp & Peace intends to focus on a tempo gameplan where turns alternate between utility Actions
   like "Read the Manual" or "Hire a Hitman" and effects like "Minor Warp Jump" that lock you out
   of Proximity gain for 1 Round. This has inherent synergy with Research Modules, which will
   trigger at the start of a Turn, preventing their next trigger, allowing you to gain Proximity
   that Turn without consequence. 


Modes:

1. Hop, Skip and, Jump
   
   This mode focuses on leaning into the more straightforward gameplan of Turns which alternate
   between Certainty/Proximity gain and more generic utility, making consistent progress until to
   out-value your opponents.

2. Keep the Peace

   Keep the Peace is a more interactive set-up, intending to leverage value from "Kallipher V0, 
   Gunderkind" and "Oculon, Who Sees Most" to disrupt opponent's gameplans while using Weapon 
   granting from "CPL.Punishment.nav" to discourage your opponent's from interfering in yours.
