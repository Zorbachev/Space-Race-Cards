BitFlip (Preconstructed Deck) Primer


Summary:
   
   BitFlip is a tempo/control list with the goal of slowing down opponents
   while building resources to win in one or two bursts of Proximity gain.
   In addition, the focus on Synthetic Recruits improves resilience and
   gameplan cohesion. 



Modes:

1. Overclock
   
   Overclock wants to build a mass of Certainty quickly by mixing Replifriend,
   Schedule a Brainstorm, and Network the Droids. Then, use Bustling Systems and
   Gear Up to build/rebuild the Ship before feeding Modules to Rasch. 
	Module Draft: Cosmolabe, Escape Pod, Positron Shielding
	Recruit Draft: Chronax, Rasch, Replifriend

2. Lockdown

   Instead of planning to have Rasch from the start, this mode intends to focus
   on shutting down opponents while you build your resources using Kerana in a 
   Runabout just sitting in your Starting System. 
	Module Draft: Dining Hall, Peer-Rating Terminal, Survey Vessel. 
	Recruit Draft: GEN.Knowledge, Kerana, Mrs. Manners


Tricks:

1. Chronax and the Tricksters
   
   Blenq, Hutvut, and Shambling Mass are all Recruits you would rather have on
   top of your Gig Pile than in your Crew, as Chronax revealing them triggers
   their abilities without them having to join your Crew.
