BitFlip (Preconstructed Deck) Primer


Summary:
   
   BitFlip is a tempo/control list with the goal of slowing down opponents while building resources
   to win in one or two bursts of Proximity gain. In addition, the focus on Synthetic Recruits 
   improves resilience and gameplan cohesion. 

   Note: Don't forget to bring out the legacy "Brightshine, Confederation Flagship" after the 
   Drafting Phase, it isn't optional!



Modes:

1. Overclock
   
   Overclock wants to build a critical mass of Certainty quickly by mixing "Replifriend AOE-17",
   "Schedule a Brainstorm", and "Network the Droids". Then, use Bustling Systems and Gear Up to
   build/rebuild the Ship before feeding Modules to "Rasch, Archon of the Second". 
      Module Draft: Cosmolabe - Escape Pod - Positron Shielding
      Recruit Draft: Chronax, Voice of Potential - Rasch, Archon of the Second - Replifriend AOE-17

2. Lockdown

   Instead of planning to have "Rasch, Archon of the Second" from the start, this mode intends to 
   focus on shutting down opponents while you build your resources using "Kerana, Child of Heaven"
   in a "Survey Vessel" just sitting detatched in your Starting System. 
	Module Draft: Dining Hall (Sponsored by Replicron) - Peer-Rating Terminal - Survey Vessel 
	Recruit Draft: GEN.Knowledge.nav - Kerana, Child of Heaven = Mrs. Manners


Tricks:

1. Chronax and the Tricksters
   
   "Blenq", "Hutvut, Stowaway", and "Shambling Mass of Bugs" are all Recruits you would rather have on
   top of your Gig Pile than in your Crew, as "Chronax, Voice of Potential" revealing them triggers
   their abilities without them having to join your Crew.
