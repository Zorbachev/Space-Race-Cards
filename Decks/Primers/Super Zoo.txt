Super Zoo (Preconstructed Deck) Primer


Summary:
   
   Super Zoo intends to focus on Feral Recruits and Positive Reputation for a
   low-setup high-velocity gameplan. Players piloting this deck should broadly
   strive to gain Proximity at every opportunity, as the list lacks access to 
   large bursts of Proximity gain. 



Modes:

1. High Turnover
   
   This mode intends to leverage synergy between "Renak, Microscopic Manager" and "Poliflumeria, 
   Phoenix of Kazrit" to rapidly gain large amounts of Reputation to then use on Actions like
   "Hitchhike in Style" or "Book a Freighter". Once you have 7-10 Reputation, "Poliflumeria, 
   Phoenix of Kazrit" should only be used for Certainty or Morale, depending on your needs in the
   circumstances. 
      Module Draft: Archeolab - Flashy Livery - Solid-State Oxyboosters
      Recruit Draft: Galfonzo, Prolific Companion - Poliflumeria, Phoenix of Kazrit - Renak, Microscopic Manager

2. Beasts of Burden

   This mode focuses on maintaining uptime on "Ouowouuaoa, Harnesswhale" using "Teev Rwin, Friend
   of Beasts" and "Xarcinicrax, Oblivous Oracle". Adding another Recruit quickly is a priority, as
   the mode is very vulnerable to "Teev Rwin, Friend of Beasts" being removed, causing a Backslide. 
      Module Draft: Habitat Simulator - Snack Nook - Solid-State Oxyboosters
      Recruit Draft: Ouowouuaoa, Harnesswhale - Teev Rwin, Friend of Beasts - Xarcinicrax, Oblivious Oracle


Tricks:

1. Zoo Escape
   
   While "Brengle, Impeccable Specimen" and "Filbup, Creature" can theoretically provide value to
   your Ship, they exist primarily to be launched at your opponents via "Zoo Escape". Both can
   rapidly ravage an opponent's board state, and are powerful disruption pieces.
