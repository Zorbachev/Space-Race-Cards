Super Zoo (Preconstructed Deck) Primer


Summary:
   
   Super Zoo intends to focus on Feral Recruits and Positive Reputation for a
   low-setup high-velocity gameplan. Players piloting this deck should broadly
   strive to gain Proximity at every opportunity, as the list lacks access to 
   large bursts of Proximity gain. 



Modes:

1. High Turnover
   
   This mode intends to leverage synergy between Renak and Poliflumeria to
   rapidly gain large amounts of Reputation to then expend on Actions like
   Hitchhike in Style or Book a Freighter. Once you have 7-10 Reputation,
   Poliflumeria should only be used for Certainty or Morale, depending on
   your needs in the circumstances. 
	Module Draft: Archeolab, Flashy Livery, Solid-State Oxyboosters
	Recruit Draft: Galfonzo, Poliflumeria, Renak

2. Beasts of Burden

   This mode focuses on maintaining uptime on Ouowouuaoa using Teev Rwin and
   Xarcinicrax's Certainty gain. Adding another Recruit quickly is a priority,
   as the mode is very vulernable to Teev being removed, causing a Backslide. 
	Module Draft: Habitat Simulator, Snack Nook, Solid-State Oxyboosters
	Recruit Draft: Ouowouuaoa, Teev Rwin, Xarcinicrax


Tricks:

1. Zoo Escape
   
   While Brengle and Filbup can theoretically provide value to your Ship, they
   exist primarily to be launched at your opponents. Both can rapidly ravage an
   opponent's board state, and are powerful disruption pieces.
